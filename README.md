# Scuffed-Ffmpeg-Helper
Python Tkinter UI to feed commands to ffmpeg easily

The script goes in the same folder as ffmpeg (bin), upon normal usage it will create a new folder where it will deliver the edited media.
The inputs are used to easily create a command for ffmpeg, empty boxes are ignored, all(?) errors should be handled by ffmpeg normally.
